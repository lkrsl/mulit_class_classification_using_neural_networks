This project implements and evaluates six single-layer neural network models for multi-class classification. The goal is to predict stock price movements (Up/Down/Sideways) based on four financial indicators. 
The workflow includes data loading, label encoding, train-test splitting, feature normalization, model training, and accuracy evaluation on a test set.
